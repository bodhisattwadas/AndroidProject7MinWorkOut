  <li>  Lie on your left side, with the whole side of your body on a mat.</li>
<li> Use your left elbow to prop up the rest of your body. Make sure of a couple things when you prop your body up on your elbow:

- Your left shoulder should be directly underneath your left elbow, aligned with one another.
- Your right arm should be resting on the right side of your shoulder.
- Only your forearm running from the ball of your fist to the end of your elbow should be supporting your weight. Your forearm should be pointed perpendicular to your body. </li>
<li>Tighten your abs and glutes as you hold your pose.</li>

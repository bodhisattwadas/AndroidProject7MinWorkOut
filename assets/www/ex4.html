  <li>Lie on your back on the floor. Using a mat or carpeted surface is more comfortable, but make sure it doesn't have too much cushioning. </li>
<li> Bend your knees. Your feet can be flat on the floor. </li>
<li> Cross your arms in front of your chest. You can also place your hands behind your neck or head, but many people tend to pull their head or neck up during the exercise, which can place extra strain on the spine. Your head and neck should be resting on your hands. </li>
<li>Lift your shoulders towards the ceiling using your abdominal muscles. It is very important not to lift your entire back off the floor, as this can cause back strain, and the extended movement does not help you develop six pack abs any faster. Exhale and contract your abs as you go up. </li>
<li>Pause at the peak. When your shoulders are off the ground, pause and hold that position for a full second (or more). </li>
<li>Ease back down slowly as you inhale. Don't just "plop" back down. Your control on the way down works your ab muscles as well. </li>

  <li>Assume a face-down prone position on the floor. Keep your feet together. Your weight should be on your chest. </li>
<li>  Position hands palms-down on the floor, approximately shoulder width apart. They should be about next to your shoulders, with your elbows pointed towards your toes. </li>
<li>   Curl your toes upward (towards your head). The balls of your feet should touch the ground. </li>
<li> Raise yourself using your arms. At this point, your weight should be supported by your hands and the balls of your feet. Make a straight line from your head to your heels. This position is called a "plank," which is used for other various exercises. This is the beginning and the end position of a single push-up. </li>

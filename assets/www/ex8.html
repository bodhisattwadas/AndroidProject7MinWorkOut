  <li>Start off on a yoga mat in the pushup position. Starting with the pushup position is the easiest way to get into the plank. </li>
<li>  Lower both your forearms to the ground so that both your elbows and fists are flat to the ground. Your palms should be balled up, and directly underneath your shoulders. </li>
<li>  Curl your toes under and engage your abs by tilting your pelvis and pulling your belly button toward your spine. </li>
<li> Straighten your body but keep your neck and spine neutral. Imagine that you're a plank of wood, and that you're straight as an arrow. </li>
<li> Flex your abdominals and squeeze your glutes. These are the two major muscle groups you'll be working out in this exercise.</li>
<li>Hold this position, also known as the plank, until after the burning begins. Keep your eyes on the floor in front of you. Avoid raising your behind. Your body should make a straight line from your heels to the back of your head. </li>
